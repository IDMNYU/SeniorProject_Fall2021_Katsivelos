# Project Plan

![Forget Perfect. Make Progress!](http://teaching.polishedsolid.com/images/gettoworkbook\_forget\_perfect.png)

_Illustration by Jolby from gettoworkbook_

The project plan will consist of a presentation and a written proposal.

This project plan will be constantly iterated over the course of the semester. It may grow and/or shrink over the course of the semester. Don't worry about "getting it right." The creative process is messy.

Please remember that you and a classmate can work as a team. Only one presentation and proposal is to be submitted per team.

* Please note that any significant changes to your project will require the submission of a revised project plan.
* Upload drafts to a folder labeled _project plan_ in your project documentation folder for your [end of semester deliverables](end\_of\_semester\_deliverables/).

| **Project Milestones**         | <p>How are you achieving this?</p><ul><li>Break down your milestones into actionable tasks using a system of your choice. I highly recommend <a href="http://trello.com">Trello</a> however, it is not required if you have another system with prioritization as a focus. If you have another system, you must share it with the instructor.</li><li>All actionable tasks should start with a verb (i.e. write, call, email, build, code, collect, etc.), and can be completed in a day.</li><li>Also be specific with your tasks. (For example, "take 20 photographs" is more explicit than "take photographs".

## Versions of Plan

Alpha, Beta, and Gold refer to a project’s life cycle. The specific parameters and expectations of each version will be individually determined in consultation with the professor.

* **Alpha** is the testing phase of form and functionality for your project.
* **Beta** is when the functionality, form, and implementation of your project is complete as possible. It is ready for user testing.
* **Gold** is when all the bugs in your project have been fixed and quality is assured. It is ready to go public.

## FEEDBACK THROUGH USER TESTING

You should be conducting research and user testing throughout the ENTIRE semester. Do not wait until the last minute to begin user testing; User testing gives you invaluable feedback about your project.
