# Design & Production Workflow \(aka Pipeline\)

## **Animation / Motion Graphics / Video Workflows**

#### **Animatic**

By midterm, those of you producing animations will need to have a POLISHED animatic.

### **Motion Graphics Pipeline**

By midterm, those of you producing videos or motion design pieces, you will need to present a POLISHED hybrid animatic.

## **Game Design and Development Pipeline**

By midterm, you should have a prototype.

## **Photo-series / Drawing / Installation Art Workflow**

It's harder to find "workflow" steps for photo series, drawings, or installation art, but a good rule of thumb is to begin with a sketch or schematic for your project.

#### For photo or drawing series:

* How many photos/drawings do you intend on including? 
* How much digital re-touching or digital compositing are you going to incorporate, either into the photos or drawings? 
* Time yourself on one image, to come up with a realistic goal about how many you can produce in the 12 weeks you have left. 

By midterm, you should have a working build \(prototype\) of your UX application or website. It does not have to have full interactivity, but all elements \(or stand in elements\) should be in place.

#### For installation art:

From your initial sketch, you'll need to make a materials and equipment list. Any special materials or equipment you need, ORDER NOW, so there's no danger in these materials arriving late and disrupting the final showcase of your work.

By midterm, you should have done an equipment check and rough build to test that all elements work together, and there are no technical or spatial issues that you need to reconsider before final implementation.

## **Sound Production Pipeline**

By midterm, you should have a scratch track produced \(this is a rough incomplete layout of the audio, it may or may not include final sound files and it is usually not mixed or edited completely yet\).

## **UX Design/ App Building / Website Design**

#### **B**egin with a user workflow \(AKA a user journey or customer journey\).

I would not worry about step 5 \(including what the user is thinking or feeling\). I would concentrate on what they're doing. You can also google "user workflow," "user journey," and/or "customer journey" to find more examples.

#### Mobile app design and production workflow

By midterm, you should have a working build \(prototype\) of your UX application or website. It does not have to have full interactivity, but all elements \(or stand in elements\) should be in place.

## Wearables

By midterm, you should have a working build \(prototype\) of your wearable.

## **XR \(VR/AR\) Pipeline**

By midterm, you should have a working build \(prototype\) of your XR application. It does not have to have full interactivity or character design, but all elements \(or stand-in elements\) should be in place. Lighting and other post-production effects are not necessary by midterm.
